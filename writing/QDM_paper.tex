\subsection{(a) Outline of the Model Structure (graphical and verbal, no equations) }
The Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) Model used for this policy analysis features
three representative agents, namely a representative household, intermediate goods firm and final goods firm, 
as well as the government. 

The reperesentative household aims to maximize its intertemporal utility, i.e. well-being 
across all periods. It derives utitlity from consumption and its utitltiy is reduced by working. To optimize the its objective
it chooses consumption, labour effort, investment in capital for the in every period. %Ct,Lt,Xt,Mt+1,Bt+1,Kt+1
Furthermore it makes choices that affect the next period,  how much money holdings to save, which determines the money available
in the next period. As well as how many bonds to pay at price $q_t$ which pay off in the next period. \emph{Should 
I say here it also chooses} $K_{t+1}$ \emph{I think that is covered by } $X_t$. When trying to maximize its utility
the reperesentative household faces two constraints. First, to consume it must have cash available beforehand, i.e. only money 
saved in the last period, at 0\% interest compared to $\frac{1}{q} -1$ from the bonds, can be used to buy consumption goods. 
The second constraint is a common budget constraint, which simply requires that income be larger than or equal to expenses. 
The households values utility derived today more highly than that derived in a future period. Thus future utility is discounted. 

The intermediate goods firm as well as the final goods firm maximize their profit.
