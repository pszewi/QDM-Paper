  abstract = {RÉSUMÉ Over the past 15 years, tax reforms have profoundly changed the shape of OECD tax systems and rekindled interest in measuring effective tax burdens. Indeed, in order to understand past reforms or to evaluate the tax policies of particular countries, it is necessary to go beyond statutory rates since these sometimes bear little relation to rates actually paid. This paper updates and extends the Mendoza et al. estimates of average effective tax rates (AETRs) and presents new estimates based on modifications to the methodology to make some of the underlying assumptions more realistic. In particular, the assumption that all income from self-employment is capital income is dropped in favour of assuming that the self-employed earn both labour and capital income. This change raises estimates of the AETR on capital and reduces the estimated AETR on labour but does not alter the trends observed in the updated Mendoza et al. estimates. Both sets of estimates show that, on average, the relative tax burden has shifted towards labour in OECD countries since the early 1980s. Considerable caution is required when interpreting AETRs as the methodology is subject to a number of limitations, not the least of which result from the difficulty of splitting income tax between capital and labour. Whether for individual countries or for the OECD as a whole, estimates of average effective tax rates should not be used as a basis for policy decisions without more broadly based analysis and corroborating data, including micro-data. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the initial impact of taxes (between capital, labour and consumption) captured by these indicators may not coincide with final incidence.},

This updated version of the model replaced {ToTEM} {II} in 2017. {ToTEM} {III}'s structure includes key aspects of household indebtedness and improved modelling of the housing market. These new features allow Bank staff to address a broader range of economic issues. Moreover, the model is estimated using a Bayesian methodology with informative priors and a larger set of observable variables, including improved measures of the factors explaining non-commodity exports. These enhancements in the model structure and estimation have contributed to significant improvements in the empirical properties of the model. We also compare the new model’s responses to key macroeconomic shocks with those of {ToTEM} {II} and explore two important policy applications.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how oil supply shocks, aggregate demand shocks, and speculative oil demand shocks affect Canada’s economy, within an estimated Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium ({DSGE}) model. The estimation is conducted using Bayesian methods, with Canadian quarterly data from 1983Q1 to 2021Q4. The results suggest that the dynamic effects of oil price shocks on Canadian macroeconomic variables vary according to their sources. In particular, a 10 percent increase in the real price of oil driven by positive foreign aggregate demand shocks has a positive effect of about 1.2 percent on Canada’s real {GDP} upon impact and the effect remains positive over time. In contrast, an increase in the real price of oil driven by negative foreign oil supply shocks or by positive speculative oil demand shocks causes a small effect of about 0.15 percent on Canada’s real {GDP} upon impact but causes a slightly decline afterwards. At the same time, an oil price increase that originates from aggregate demand shock causes an increase in consumption and investment, while an oil price increase that originates from oil supply shocks or from speculative oil demand shocks cause a decline in consumption and investment. Furthermore, among the identified oil shocks, aggregate demand shocks have been by fare more important in explaining the variations of most of Canadian macroeconomic variables over the estimation period. In contrast, speculative oil demand shock appears to be the first source of variations in real oil price.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the large gap between the microeconometric estimates of the Frisch labor supply elasticity (0–.5) and the values used by macroeconomists to calibrate general equilibrium models (2–4). These two ranges identify two fundamentally different notions, the micro and macro Frisch elasticity, respectively. Due to the different definitions, there are two restrictions in the micro Frisch elasticity that are relaxed in the macro Frisch elasticity. First, the micro Frisch elasticity focuses only on prime-aged married males who are the head of their household, while the macro Frisch elasticity represents the whole population. Second, the micro Frisch elasticity only incorporates intensive margin fluctuations in hours, while the macro Frisch elasticity includes both intensive and extensive margin fluctuations. This paper finds that relaxing these two restrictions causes estimates of the Frisch elasticity to increase from 0.2 to between 2.9 and 3.1, indicating that these two restrictions can explain the gap between the microeconometric estimates and the calibration values. However, this paper demonstrates that these estimates of the macro Frisch elasticity are sensitive to the estimation procedure and also the exclusion of older individuals, implying that calibration values used for macroeconomic models should be selected carefully.

Although the general discussion still seems to be prevailed by Hall's early {EIS} estimates close to zero, we show that several deviations from the time-additive constant relative risk aversion model speak in favor of considerably higher values. Our treatment is supposed to provide researchers a hint at which parameter is a reasonable and incontrovertible choice for the calibration of models in macroeconomics and finance.},

  abstract = {How can price elasticities be identified when agents face optimization frictions such as adjustment costs or inattention? I derive bounds on structural price elasticities that are a function of the observed effect of a price change on demand, the size of the price change, and the degree of frictions. The degree of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum. The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin elasticities. I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply. The utility costs of ignoring the tax changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than 1\% of earnings. As a result, small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities, extensive and intensive margin elasticities, and other disparate findings. Pooling estimates from existing studies, I estimate a Hicksian labor supply elasticity of 0.33 on the intensive margin and 0.25 on the extensive margin after accounting for frictions.},
